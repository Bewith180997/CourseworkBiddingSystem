# CourseworkBiddingSystem

Year 2 - Software Development Course
This coursework involved implementing a program planned in previous coursework. The overall system was split up as evenly as possible across everyone, the code provided is my contribution.
The project, regretably, did not reach its maximum potential. As such, there may be places in my section of the program that was not implemented due to unfinished required modules. However, did provide a lot of experience in software development in a newly-developed group.
FXML Files are used to design a basic user interface.
